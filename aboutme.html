  <h1>Welcome to my about page!</h1>
  <p data-start="140" data-end="514">Hi, my name is Anthony Lee, and I’m a 10th grade student at El Camino. I’m passionate about Graphic Design and enjoy working on creative projects through WordPress. Outside of school, I spend a lot of time with my dog, Weird Chuwawa, who’s always keeping life interesting. I also enjoy staying active with hobbies like baseball, golfing, e-biking, hiking, swimming, and riding my boogie board. Music is another big part of my life it inspires me and helps me stay focused. As a student, I’m always exploring new ways to learn, grow, and express myself through design, creativity, and everyday adventures.</p>
<p>This is my first time in Web design and my 2nd year in Graphic</p>
