  <h1>Here's a little bit more about me:&nbsp; &nbsp;</h1>
  <p data-start="140" data-end="514">Baseball has always been one of my favorite activities, both to play and to watch. I especially enjoy watching the Dodgers play every night, as it has become part of my daily routine and something I look forward to. The excitement of the game, the energy of the crowd, and the strategy behind each play make baseball a sport I truly appreciate. It is not only entertaining but also a way for me to connect with others who share the same passion. Another activity I enjoy is spending time at the beach. The beach gives me a chance to relax, enjoy the fresh air, and take in the calming atmosphere. It is also a place where I can be active, whether that means walking along the shore or playing games in the sand with friends. In addition, I enjoy working on graphic design, which allows me to use my creativity and express my ideas visually. Designing gives me a sense of accomplishment and helps me improve my artistic and technical skills. Beyond these interests, I also value spending time with my friends. Hanging out with them gives me the opportunity to build memories, share laughs, and strengthen friendships. I also enjoy playing video games, which give me both excitement and relaxation after a long day. Altogether, these interests baseball, the beach, graphic design, spending time with friends, and video gamesâ€”reflect who I am and the things that bring balance and enjoyment to my life.</p>
